a user clicks the 'add review' button
that button fires off a function
this function calls uppon a service
that service sends a request to the server
a route on the server catches the request 
that route calls uppon a controller function

controller function:
checks our DB for an existing game with this RAWG API id if the contrller cant find a game with that RAWG API id,
it will create a new game in our DB

once a game exists in our DB, the controller function can create a review 
and associate it with that game 

questions
-what data do we need to send back to the controller function when creating a review?
-what should the controller function return?
-where should our first function be? (<GameDetails />)

-Currently, gamedetails is holding state with info from RAWG.
  -what additional pieces of state do we need to use along side that?
